ackam: Android camera that automatically captures, stores, and shares

This should be useful in a variety of situations in which getting (and sharing)
the picture is more important than its quality.
In some such situations it is also important that not only does the picture go
to the right place but that it does not go to the wrong place; for this reason
ackam should also support a number of privacy and protection options;
see also https://github.com/schlafwandler/EnCam as it shares this goal.


This project targets API level 1 for maximum compatibility.
Any features deprecated in newer APIs should be avoided where possible.
Where it is not possible to avoid deprecated or newer features or their use is
more aesthetic than functional, they should be used by reflection.

This project was created using the Android SDK (r15) `android' tool.
Building requires the Android SDK and Apache ant.
To build, first create a file `local.properties' containing a line
sdk.dir=/path/to/android-sdk
Replacing `/path/to/android-sdk' with the path on your system to the Android SDK
On GNU/Linux and other Unix-/POSIX-like systems this may be /opt/android-sdk
On Windows it may be C:\\Program Files\\Android\\android-sdk
Building is then handled by `ant'.
